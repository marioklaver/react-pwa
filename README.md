## App always available

### Introduction

In this section we will make your app always available, no matter what the status of your internet connection is.

### Steps

#### Register the service worker
By default, service workers donâ€™t become active and available for use until you register them. To learn more, you can read up on the fundamentals of the service worker life cycle.

Go to the src/index.tsx file in your project and find the following lines of code:

```typescript
// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change
// unregister() to register() below. Note this comes with some pitfalls.
// Learn more about service workers: https://cra.link/PWA
serviceWorker.unregister();
```

To register the service worker for use, simply modify the last line so that it looks like the following:

```ts
serviceWorkerRegistration.register();
```

The src/service-worker.ts file is now registered and ready to play its key role in providing an offline-first experience for your users.
